## Group-Counter
This is a simple piece of code designed to count and announce new and lost group members, I've open sourced this because I'm tired of seeing people make something as simple as this a paid service, or a free service with a silly watermark that you cannot remove.
## Installation
1) Clone/Download this repository to somewhere safe on your PC
2) Run `npm i` within the folder using a terminal to install all required packages.
3) Open a text editor and edit the `config.json` file to your desired configurations.
4) Run `node index.js` to start Group-Counter, and you're all done!
## config.json
I've tried to make this as customizeable as possible for developers that may not be very experienced with Node.JS, so I've made a fun config file for you to use 😄!

You should set `"ServerId"` & `"ChannelId"` to the ID of your Discord Server, and the Channel ID of where you want to post the updates. You should also then set BotToken to your Discord Bot Token.

The rest of the indexes should be quite self-explanatory, so I'm going to skip to the final two which are `IncreaseString` & `DecreaseString`!

*IncreaseString* will be sent by the webhook when a group gains members, and *DecreaseString* will be sent by the webhook when the group looses members (🙁). I've made it
really easy to configure these, as I know some people might not like a default message that you can't really change.

You can utilise three different "formats" (idk the official term) to make your string work.
1) **[GROUPNAME]** --> The group name
2) **[N]** --> How many members have been gained/lost
3) **[M]** --> The string "member" but if [N] is greater than 1, it'll be "members" 😀

For example, you could set IncreaseString to something like:

`📣 [GROUPNAME] has gained [N] [M]!` --> **`📣 Scriptbloxian Studios has gained 15 members!`**
